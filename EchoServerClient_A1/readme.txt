I have run my code in Ubuntu 14.04 like these following steps

1. First I have opened two terminals (each for both server and client).
2. Then I went to the directory containing the codes from both the terminals.
3. After that first I ran the server code by typing "python echo_ser.py" in one terminal.
4. Then I ran my client code "python echo_cli.py" in another terminal.
