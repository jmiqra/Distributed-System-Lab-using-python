I have run my code in Ubuntu 14.04 like these following steps

1. 
1. I have opened four terminals (for 1 server and 3 clients).

2. Then I went to the directory containing the codes from the terminals.

3. After that first I ran the server code by typing "python kkserver.py" in one terminal.
4. Then I ran my client code "python kkclient.py" in the other three terminals.
