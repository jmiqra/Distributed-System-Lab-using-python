We have run my code in Ubuntu 14.04 like these following steps

1. We have opened 7 terminals (for 1 master, 3 servers and 3 clients).

2. Then we went to the directory containing the codes from the terminals.

3. After that first we ran the servers(workers) code by typing "python worker1.py","python worker2.py","python worker3.py" in 3 terminals.

4. Then we ran our master code "python master.py" in one terminal.

5. Finally we ran our client code "python client.py" in the other three terminals.
